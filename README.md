# EvEqCoTh2023NhFHN
This repository contains codes to simulate a non-homogeneous system of the FitzHugh-Nagumo type (Nh-FHN). 
The main progam is the .cpp code and its header .h. We simulate the system \eps u'=-u^3+3u-v+u_{xx}, v'=u-c(x).
Othere files are data or programs to help visualization in gnuplot
